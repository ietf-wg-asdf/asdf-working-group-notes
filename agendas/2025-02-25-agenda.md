## WORK

This meeting will be a working meeting.
More of a design team meeting than presentations and the like.
Please come with your github logged in, and your best kramdown-fu.
Our goal is to take the digital-twin document, get it into a new github repo,
and break it up into two documents allowing the non-Affordance work to be
clearly broken out.

(Please don't fear that if you do some text lifting that you'll be the stuckee forever for it. Unless you want to be.)

Our goal here is to accelerate the efforts around these documents, so that we aren't just working three times a year.
